## My personal ricing on the cake

The import | export feature in misc settings can be derpy at times. For root users, it is better to backup and restore the copy manually or automatically (via app). Some text editors might not correctly encode the data, and may have missing and jumbled keys.

theme.txt
settings.txt
user-dictionary.txt PRIVATE EMPTY FILES
autotext.txt
next-word.txt

My layout is the default QWERTY(left up right arrows). I just love the usability. Here is whay it looks like with the different mods

My word prediction (bar) is also very boring. While there are many combo mcwombos available, I rely on the clipboard and my undo and redo.
