# Multing O Keyboard (MOK)

Prolly the most customizable keyboard out there, it deserves all the praise other keyboards have gotten. Gboard is going to have an "undo" feature? Welp, MOK has that covered, and a pretty high amount of undo registers. It even has a "redo" feature.

## Ricing on the cake

The pros of MOK is also its downfall. With its high customizability, macro keyboard users will feel right at home. It is not a smart keyboard, but it requires a smart human to be able to use it efficiently. People these days are allergic to learning, let alone RTFM.

While the app has not been updated since September 2nd, 2020, I have used it well to great surprise on A13. Everything works as it should, except the system was constantly working behind my back. A14 is in the works and I will definitely test it later.
